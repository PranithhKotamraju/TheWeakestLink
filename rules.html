                            When the game is launched, the player should be greeted with a welcome window that would allow him or her to start the game or see the rules of the game by hitting the respective buttons or icons. The game must then proceed to capture the player’s name and age,then navigate the user to round 1 of the game.

                                    The game is broken up into three rounds, the first two rounds allow the player to bank and earn money whereas, the last round is a sudden death wrong that will determine if he or she will walk away with the total money banked in the two previous rounds; or loose the game and be labeled as the “WEAKEST LINK”. Note, the objective of round 1 and 2 is to create a chain of consecutive correct answers to earn an increasing amount of money from a “Money Tree” for a “bank pot” within a specific time limit. An incorrect answer breaks the chain and loses all the money accumulated up to that point; however, the player can say "bank", (press a bank button), prior to their question being asked, the accumulated money is stored, and the “Money Tree” resets to zero. For every question asked, the game must provide 4 possible answer choices to allow the player to choose the correct answer.

                                    If the player answers a question correctly, the money will move upwards the “Money Tree”, by one level. If the player answers the question wrong, the money is lost and the “Money Tree” starts from $0 again. Before a question is asked, the player is allowed to bank the money that corresponds to the level they are at on the “Money Tree”. However, the player should not be allowed to bank money if they are on level $0 on the money tree. If the player banks the money it stays safe, however the “Money Tree”, will start again, from $0. Note: the maximum you can bank for this round is $500,000 Once the timer runs out, the player will automatically go onto round 2 along with all money banked. Also, if the user banks $500,000 before the timer runs out they will automatically go onto round 2. If the person has $0 after round 1, they automatically lose the game. BANK -> $100,000

            Once the player qualifies for Round 2 then they will be required to answer a series of questions within 1 minute, in this Sudden death round. Once the player correctly answer all questions asked within the specified time then they will win the game and walk away with all the money that was banked. However, any question answered incorrectly will automatically cause the player to lose the game and be deemed, “The Weakest Link”
            If time runs out before the number of questions is complete, YOU ARE THE WEAKEST LINK, GOODBYE!
